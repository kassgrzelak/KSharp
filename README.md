A tree-walking interpreted language I made in October 2024 using Robert Nystrom's book, Crafting Interpreters.

This project was one of my first times using C#. I pretty much learned it as I went, largely due to the fact that the book expected you
to code in Java, so the process of translating between the two forced me to learn C# and basically made it impossible to just mindlessly
copy code from the book.
I also made sure to use the understanding gained by reading the book to implement my own custom features.
